The graphs below show data on a range of development indicators. <br>
They can be explored by adjusting the axes (to show more/less data), hovering over contents (to show exact values), clicking on the labels in the legends (to turn data on/off), and by using the available drop-down options.<br>
The underlying data can be downloaded using the links provided under 'data source' for each graph.<br>

The graph above shows the number of consented new homes and the estimated growth in households. This provides a rough indication of over-supply and under-supply of housing over time. <br>
Due to the population data available, the data is this graph is based from July-June years rather than calendar years. As a result, values may seem different to those on other graphs on this website.<br>
Household growth is based on census data for 1996, 2001, 2006, 2013 and 2018. Estimated population growth is used to interpolate between census years.<br>
The graph can also be configured to show the number of new constructed homes, as well as projected growth in dwellings.<br>

<p><b>Data sources</b><br>

Consent data in these graphs is based on building consents. Building consent data is collated by Dunedin City Council and Statistics New Zealand.<br>
Data on constructed homes is based on code compliance certificate (CCCs). These are issued at the end of construction work to confirm that it complies with the building code and relevant building consent.<br>
An assessment of historic building consents and CCCs shows that approximately 88% of building consents for new homes are subsequently constructed.<br>
