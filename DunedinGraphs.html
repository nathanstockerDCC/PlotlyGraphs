The graphs below show data on a range of development indicators. <br>
They can be explored by adjusting the axes (to show more/less data), hovering over contents (to show exact values), clicking on the labels in the legends (to turn data on/off), and by using the available drop-down options.<br>
The underlying data can be downloaded using the links provided under 'data source' for each graph.<br>

This graph shows the number of consented new homes and the estimated growth in households. This provides a rough indication of over-supply and under-supply of housing over time. <br>
Due to the population data available, the data is this graph is based from July-June years rather than calendar years. As a result, values may seem different to those on other graphs on this website.<br>
Household growth is based on census data for 1996, 2001, 2006, 2013 and 2018. Estimated population growth is used to interpolate between census years.<br>
The graph can also be configured to show the number of new constructed homes, as well as projected growth in dwellings.<br>

<p>
This graph presents indices of housing affordability to show how this has changed over time. Lower values indicate more affordable housing.<br>
The housing affordability index is the ratio of the average house value to average annual earnings.<br>
The rental affordability index is the ratio of the average weekly rent to average weekly earnings. Seasonal fluctation in the index is caused by the different types of rental accommodation being let at different times of year. December/January values are heavily impacted by the student rental market. <br>

<p>
House values are sourced from QVNZ and are average current values. An average current value is the average (mean) value of all developed residential properties in the area based on the house value index from QVNZ. It is not an average or median sales price, as both of those figures only measure what happens to have sold in the period. These average current values are affected by the underlying value of houses (including those not on the market) and are quality adjusted based on the growth in each houseâ€™s price between sales.

This graph presents estimates of rental costs over time, using a 12 month rolling average. 
Each point on the graph reflects the average rent of the 12 months to that date. 
The rental costs are estimated using data comes from MBIE's tenancy bond database, which records all new rental bonds that are lodged with MBIE.

<p><b>Data sources</b><br>

Consent information in these graphs refer to building consents. Building consent data is collated by Dunedin City Council and Statistics New Zealand.<b>
Data on constructed homes is based on code compliance certificate (CCCs). These are issued at the end of construction work to confirm that it complies with the building code and relevant building consent.<b>
An assessment of historic building consents and CCCs shows that approximately 88% of building consents for new homes are subsequently constructed.<b>
