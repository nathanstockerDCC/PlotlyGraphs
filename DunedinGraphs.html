They can be explored by adjusting the axes (to show more/less data), hovering over contents (to show exact values), clicking on the labels in the legends (to turn data on/off), and by using the available drop-down options.<br>
The underlying data can be downloaded using the links under 'data source'.<br>

This graph shows the number of dwellings for which building consents have been granted, as well as estimated population increase. <br>
This is meant to provide a rough indication of over-supply and under-supply of housing over time. <br>
Due to the population data available, this graph uses years from July-June rather than calendar years. <br>
As a result, values may seem different to those on other graphs on this website.<br>
Consented housing capacity is estimated by multiplying the number of consented dwellings by the average Dunedin City household size.<br>
In addition to population growth, extra demand for dwellings will also arise from changes of household formation (e.g. the trend for smaller households).<br>

This graph presents indices of housing affordability to show how this has changed over time. Lower values indicate more affordable housing.
The housing affordability index is the ratio of the average house value to average annual earnings.<br>
The rental affordability index is the ratio of the average weekly rent to average weekly earnings.<br>

<p>
This graph presents estimates of rental costs over time, using a 12 month rolling average. 
Each point on the graph reflects the average rent of the 12 months to that date. 
The rental costs are estimated using data comes from MBIE's tenancy bond database, which records all new rental bonds that are lodged with MBIE.
