The graph above presents indices of housing affordability to show how this has changed over time. Lower values indicate more affordable housing.<br>
The housing affordability index is the ratio of the average house value to average annual earnings.<br>
The rental affordability index is the ratio of the average weekly rent to average weekly earnings. Seasonal fluctation in the rental index is caused by the different types of rental accommodation being let at different times of year. Fourth quarter (Q4) values are heavily impacted by the student rental market. <br>

The graph above presents estimates of rental costs over time, using a 12 month rolling average. 
Each point on the graph reflects the average rent of the 12 months to that date. 
The rental costs are estimated using data comes from MBIE's tenancy bond database, which records all new rental bonds that are lodged with MBIE.

In the graph above, estimated population growth is sourced from Statistics New Zealand. <br>
Projected population growth is based on Statistics New Zealand projections released in 2017 and refined by Russell Jones on behalf of Dunedin City Council.<br>
These projections were developed before Covid-19. Dunedin City Council is currently reviewing the possible impacts of Covid-19 and developing appropriate growth assumptions to incorporate into the upcoming 10 year plan. These may differ from the projections shown above.
