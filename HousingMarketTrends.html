They can be explored by adjusting the axes (to show more/less data), hovering over contents (to show exact values), clicking on the labels in the legends (to turn data on/off), and by using the available drop-down options.<br>
The underlying data can be downloaded using the links provided under 'data source' for each graph.<br>

The graph above presents indices of housing affordability to show how this has changed over time. Lower values indicate more affordable housing.<br>
The housing affordability index is the ratio of the average house value to average annual earnings.<br>
The rental affordability index is the ratio of the average weekly rent to average weekly earnings. Seasonal fluctation in the index is caused by the different types of rental accommodation being let at different times of year. December/January values are heavily impacted by the student rental market. <br>

<p>
In the graph above, house values are sourced from QVNZ and are presented as the average (mean) current value of all developed residential properties based on the house value index from QVNZ. 
These differ from average or median sales prices, which only measure what happens to have sold in each period.

<p>
The graph above presents estimates of rental costs over time, using a 12 month rolling average. 
Each point on the graph reflects the average rent of the 12 months to that date. 
The rental costs are estimated using data comes from MBIE's tenancy bond database, which records all new rental bonds that are lodged with MBIE.
