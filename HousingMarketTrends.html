The graph above presents indices of housing affordability to show how this has changed over time. Lower values indicate more affordable housing.<br>
The housing affordability index is the ratio of the average house value to average annual earnings.<br>
The rental affordability index is the ratio of the average weekly rent to average weekly earnings. Seasonal fluctation in the rental index is caused by the different types of rental accommodation being let at different times of year. Fourth quarter (Q4) values are heavily impacted by the student rental market. <br>
